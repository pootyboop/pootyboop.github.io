                Pooty Games is a Minecraft multiplayer minigame map I've been working on here and there over the last few years.
                It includes my rendition of some pre-existing games (like Bedwars) and a bunch of original games.

            <p>
                From a game design perspective, Minecraft is great for quickly prototyping 3D multiplayer game concepts.
                I have used it as a platform for many multiplayer games because it a) provides high-level networked multiplayer out of the box and b) has a huge preexisting player base, meaning I can trick my friends into enjoying playtesting my games!
            </p>
            <p>
                This map is entirely vanilla using Minecraft's datapacks. I have been working on it across multiple Minecraft updates, changing games to use newer features and creating new games based on new Minecraft features.
