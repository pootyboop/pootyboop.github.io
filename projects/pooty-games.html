                Pooty Games is my game design testing chamber and a Minecraft multiplayer minigame map I've been working on here and there over the last few years.
                It includes my rendition of some pre-existing games (e.g. Bedwars, Hide and Seek, Build Comp) and a bunch of original games (e.g. Warden's Dungeon, Gold Rush, Paul Heist).
            </p>

            <p>
                <b>Please note</b>: the version below requires cheats/commands to be enabled. This allows players to click commands in chat, which is necessary for some games like Build Comp and Gold Rush.

            <p>
                From a game design perspective, Minecraft is great for quickly prototyping 3D multiplayer game concepts.
                I have used it as a platform for many multiplayer games because it a) provides high-level networked multiplayer out of the box and b) has a huge preexisting player base, meaning I can trick my friends and siblings into playtesting my games!
                This has been super valuable for me to test out everything from movement systems to hidden role party games.
            </p>
            <p>
                This map is vanilla, made using Minecraft's datapack system. I have been working on it across multiple Minecraft updates (since 1.16), changing games to use newer features and creating new games based on new Minecraft features like interaction entities and function macros.
            </p>

                    <div id="collapseOne" class="accordion-collapse collapse" aria-labelledby="headingOne" data-bs-parent="#accordionExample">
                        <div class="accordion-body">
                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                    When you hold shift in <b>Hide and Seek</b>, an invisible leash knot is spawned beneath you. Leash knots (normally attached to fences) automatically snap to the nearest block position. The knot then spawns the fake block representing the player relative to its snapped location. This makes the fake block "snap into place" and blend in with the environment.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    Right click detection on <b>FPS</b> is done with 1.20's interaction entities. An interaction entity follows the player's vision around, consuming left and right click inputs from the player and then firing raycasts from their view. This allows you to fire with left click like most shooters, and aim down sights with right click (achieved by giving the player slowness to zoom in their FOV).
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    The <b>Gold Rush</b> map is full of "cave air", a different block than regular "air". When players mine gold ore, they leave behind an air block. After the game is finished, the map repopulates all gold ore by replacing air blocks (<em>NOT cave air</em>) with gold ore.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    Tapping the sneak key in <b>Ham Soccer</b> makes the player leap forward. Minecraft doesn't allow you to modify the player's motion directly, so instead ~20 invisible slimes spawn right behind/under the player's feet. The number of collisions in that single frame propel the player forward.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    The high jumps you can perform in <b>Geokinesis</b> are created by applying a very high amount of the levitation effect to the player and then quickly removing it. When holding sneak to slam back down to the ground, a different levitation value is used which inverts the effect, increasing the player's gravity.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <b>Bedwars</b> uses adventure mode so players can't destroy the map, but every item in the game can break every placeable/modifiable part of the map, so it seems like the game is in survival mode. All placeable blocks are destroyed at the start of each game using a stepped system where an armor stand iterates across the map and deletes all undesired blocks.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    In <b>Witch Hunt</b>, <b>Track Racing</b>, and other games where you control/own an entity or games with a voting system, player UUIDs are stored in a scoreboard and assigned to the corresponding entities to keep them synced.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <b>Dance of the Block</b> and <b>Trials</b> both revolve around cloning (the dancefloor or the trial). To select a random entry to clone, each entry is a uniform distance apart in-game, then a random value is used with a function macro to select a random coordinate position to clone from.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <b>PvP Playground</b>'s Thermal Caves map has a hot and cold state. They're switched between with an invisible marker that sweeps across the map, cloning in blocks in waves and using particles to make it look like the map is freezing over or burning up. Players also hear a sweeping noise (the elytra equip sound) as the wave passes over them.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    Rather than using player selectors like @a or @p, <b>PvP Playground</b> treats all entities marked as "fighters" as players. This means you can have NPCs on your team or fight the training dummy in the lobby and they're treated just like any other player. While not implemented right now, this also means mobs could have loadouts and use weapon abilities too!
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    The dungeon merchants in <b>Delve</b> are represented by armor stands at 90% scale with an invisible wandering trader on top of them. This prevents enemies in the dungeon from killing the wandering trader while still allowing you to right click for the nice wandering trader trading UI.
                                </li>
