                VR, but your controllers are on your feet! Set on a theater stage, Steve must follow (or disobey) commands from the Director by stomping and kicking.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Director (inspired by The Stanley Parable) runs the play, narrating the actions Steve is supposed to take to prepare for his date. With further development, the Director would get angry when the player disobeys him and tape down objects that used to be kickable.

                This was our project from the Hackathon held during the
                <a href="https://www.scienceandmediamuseum.org.uk/whats-on/yorkshire-games-festival" target="_blank">2023 Yorkshire Games Festival</a>.
                The theme was "the future of entertainment," so we experimented with using the player's feet as new points of VR motion tracking. This opened up new interactions like stepping into shoes and kicking wadded paper off-stage.
            </p>
            <p>
                Developed over 48 hours, the art and narrative were created by
                <a href="https://hypemstar.tumblr.com/" target="_blank">Emi Richardson</a>
                and
                <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/mara-solomon-36651b169/" target="_blank">Mara Solomon.</a>
                The project was coded by
                <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ziqi-fang-26025a209/" target="_blank">Ziqi Fang</a>
                and I (Elliot Mann). I was also the voice actor for the Director. We used Unity, a Quest 2, and two elbow braces to attach the Quest controllers to the player's shoes.
            </p>
            <p>
                I managed all tech for the project using C# and DearVR.
