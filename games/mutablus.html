                        <p>
                            There are a handful of structures to find across Mutablus.
                            Some are fairly common while others are tougher to find.
                            Here is a complete list of each structure and where to find it:
                        </p>

                        <ul class="help-list">

                            <span class="highlight">House</span> - usually found near mountains.
                            Houses are fairly common and can appear by themselves or in rare mountain cities.
                            They only crop up in grassy areas and contain workbenches (needed to craft shovels).
                            </li>

                            <li class="mutablus-li">

                            <span class="highlight">Cave</span> - a common small structure.
                            Caves appear in stoney areas, typically in groups of 3 or more.
                            Each cave has a small number of picks for you to collect.
                            </li>

                            <li class="mutablus-li">
                            <span class="highlight">Boat</span> - an abandoned ship.
                            They appear on the water, sometimes docked in a small pool.
                            Boats are uncommon and always hold a map in the captain's quarters.
                            </li>

                            <span class="highlight">Pyramid</span> - home of the pharoah.
                            Pharoahs offer orbs in exchange for idols and ore.
                            Pyramids are uncommon and appear exclusively in sandy areas.
                            </li>

                            <span class="highlight">Tower</span> - the rarest structure in Mutablus.
                            Towers offer free orbs, making them a much easier alternative to gathering ore for pharoahs.
                            Towers are rare, appearing only in snowy areas.

                        <p>
                            Mutablus is a simple exploration game.
                            You will start in a randomly generated area possibly including trees, rivers, and snowmen.
                            Walk off-screen in any direction to enter a new area.
                            You will find houses, boats, pyramids, and other structures in the world.
                            Walk into things to interact with them.
                        </p>

                        <h2 class="mutablus-h2">Mutablus Mutates</h2>

                        <p>
                            When you enter a new area, the previous area will transform.
                            Forests might become slightly different forests and deserts might become oceans.
                            Keep this in mind when entering buildings - you won't always walk out to the same area you entered from!
                        </p>

                            Logs allow you to cross water and, more importantly, put arms on snowmen.

                            Keep in mind that they are consumable and break after a single use!

                            You can always find one on a boat.
                            Maps don't always reveal something when used - they can be hard to decipher!

                            They are obtained by trading ore to a pharoah or by finding a tower.
                            If you don't want to collect these, you can "poor man's orb" by walking back and forth off the screen.

                            Alternatively, you can place an idol atop a totem for a bunch of new tools.

                Mutablus is a top-down exploration and item management game set in an ever-changing, procedurally generated world. The world contains different biomes, structures, and items to find.            </p>

                Mutablus was a 2nd year university project developed in JavaScript with p5.js.
                It uses wave function collapse to generate terrain and structures,
                drawing inspiration from old-school exploration games like Adventure and the Ultima series as well as procedural worldgen and its use in <a href="https://twitter.com/OskSta?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor" target="_blank">Oskar Stålberg</a>’s games like Bad North.

                                When creating Mutablus, I was fascinated with the Wave Function Collapse algorithm used by <a href="https://twitter.com/OskSta?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor" target="_blank">Oskar Stålberg</a> and other developers to create a procedurally generated world without the use of Perlin noise.
                                I reverse engineered a simple version of the algorithm in <a href="https://p5js.org/" target="_blank">p5.js</a>.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                After an initial seed-based generation which collapses all tiles to a singular possiblility, two more passes are applied to modify the environment (e.g. add structures, generate certain biomes) before a final quality pass which removes ugly isolated tiles. Seed-based "random" values are used to determine the biome, structures, some world gen factors, and other points of interest.

                            <p>
                                As the JavaScript is hosted here for the game to run, you can <a href="mutablus/js/wavefunctioncollapsemanager.js" target="_blank">read my algorithm for yourself</a> (and by extension, the individual <a href="mutablus/js/tile.js" target="_blank">Tile class</a>).

            <p>
                The idea for a mutable world originated from swirlstorms in the <a href="/projects/hierre">Hierre system</a> - mysterious waves that rearrange solid objects while leaving them almost entirely undamaged (like the eye of a tornado).
