                Sandboard is a PC VR sand surfing and grappling game for Oculus Quest (2) and HTC Vive. With a sandboard at your feet and two grapple hands at your disposal, zip down sandy slopes, fly off boosts, and use your grapples to propel yourself through the Arverre badlands.

            <p>
                This was a 1st year university project initially developed over the course of four months in Unreal Engine 4 with a Quest 2 headset. I continued development as a personal project until late 2023, releasing 3 post-release updates including new features, levels, and fixes. I made 3D assets in Blender, textures in GIMP and Photoshop, sound effects and music in Logic Pro (mostly with the Massive synth), and game trailers in Premiere.
            </p>
            <p>
                Sandboard draws inspiration from sand surfing in games like The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild and Journey and grappling in VR games such as Swarm and Spider-Man: Far From Home Virtual Reality. Other visual influences are Dune (2021), Monster Hunter 4, Shadow of the Colossus, Raised by Wolves, Mad Max, and the Borderlands series.

            <p>
                The game is designed to be immersive and (relatively) nausea free. In real life, the player stands still and aims their hands. In the game, the player character takes these same actions. I was very careful to avoid half-baked locomotion options like running by moving just your arms, not your legs. I also implemented accessibility features like tunnel vision, toggleable UI, and tutorial tips in levels.
            </p>

                The surfing system is weighted between the slope you're surfing on and the direction you're looking. This gives the player more control than purely slope-based movement. The grapples are the player's main navigation tool, allowing you to dodge obstacles and clear gaps.
                I based the grappling system off of Respawn Entertainment's games, where they are often used as tools of propulsion rather than pulling you directly to the hit location.
            </p>

            <p>
                Development is completed for now as I have moved onto other projects, but I may resume in the future.
            </p>

            <h2>üèú SETTING</h2>
            <hr>
            <p>
                Sandboard takes place in the rural Arverre region of Ronetto, a desert planet in the <a href="/projects/hierre">Hierre system</a>. Arverre is untouched by the Regin corporation, making it a refuge for outsiders willing to face its dramatic terrain and dangerous wildlife. Some groups settle down in discreet villages like Tephrenne while others patrol the desert for travellers to raid.
            </p>
            <p>
                Arverre is also popular with daredevils (like the player) looking to hone their sandboarding skills. Relatively low-tech transportation like sandboarding is popular due to the planet's lack of resources ‚Äî hence there aren't any spaceships or androids flying past. However, future levels may see some off-world tech come into play ;)
