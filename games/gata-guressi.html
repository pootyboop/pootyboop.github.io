                Gata Guressi is a sci-fi RPG tech demo about the various planets and cultures of <a href="/projects/hierre">Hierre</a>, a fictional star system. You are Quuvol, a merchant who has travelled to trade port Kallay Tirridor on the planet of Voenn to sell a valuable shipment of a resource called ielsek.
            </p>
            <p>
                Quuvol is Guressi (native of the planet Guressen). Guressen's former government practised slavery, turning the rest of the system against Guressen and spreading the idea that all Guressi are slavers. Guressen's new leader Iusol has outlawed slavery, but the system is still skeptical of Guressi.
            </p>
            <p>
                Characters speak one or more of 10 languages which you must translate to sell ielsek. Languages aren't just random words - you can actually learn them and play without the translator if you wish.

            <p>
                This was a 3rd year university project developed in Unity. I aimed to develop a cohesive, immersive, optimized experience that simulated a slice of a larger sci-fi RPG.
                A few of the game's inspirations include Prey's Talos I, Cyberpunk 2077's Heavy Hearts Club, Star Wars' Cantina, No Man's Sky's spaceships, and rotation sushi restaurants.

                                Each language has conventions and an auditory identity to build cohesion. Lunsca is nearly impossible for non-native speakers to understand. Sorpri uses long, flowery words and names instead of pronouns. Hiesca uses consistent prefixes, suffixes, and sounds to build its identity (e.g. the sound ‚Äúie‚Äù, two-syllable words, locations of importance ending with -enne, -erre, or -ette).

                I wrote fictional languages and heavily built on the <a href="/projects/hierre">Hierre universe</a> for this project. Each planet/region has an icon, culture, aesthetic identity, and language which you can learn about by speaking to its inhabitants and inspecting cultural objects like banners, statues, etc.

                                I developed a random character creator that generates all of Gata Guressi's characters at runtime. Using gradients, I created an easily modifiable set of colors which characters would source for their skin tone, eye color, clothing color, etc. They also select from different clothing textures.

                                Characters' bodies are made up of a collection of meshes for each body part. The parts a character is made up of (including their clothing and technical implants) represents their culture, status, and political/religious alignments. High collars and asymmetric sleeves are popular with traders, while metal/LED ornamentation is a staple of system-wide fashion.

            <h2>üèî SETTING</h2>
            <hr>
            <p>
                Gata Guressi takes place at Kallay Tirridor ("The Pinnacle Trade Port"), an upscale bar on the planet of Voenn in the <a href="/projects/hierre">Hierre system</a>. Kallay Tirridor was originally just a local bar, but expanded to become one of Voenn's biggest pit stops after its signature drink Bollet Voenni gained international popularity.
            </p>
            <p>
                Voenn is a low-population stoney/mossy planet in the Hierre Sor region. The population is made up of small communities united under Jan Kilen, Voenn's lax leader. Life on Voenn is slow, local, and centered around arts such as music and sculpting. Voenn's fauna and geology have made it an international wonder, drawing tourism and trade from across the system.
            </p>
            <p>
                Hierre Sor is the remote "southern" region of Hierre including planets Guressen, Voenn, Lunscu, and Lunscu's moon Dorbis. It has a lower population than the other half of the system, but thrives on tourism and trade for its rich cultures and exotic fauna/flora.
            </p>
            <p>
                <a href="/projects/hierre">Hierre</a> is a paradise system where every planet is habitable. The Hierri colony occupied the system 485 years before the events of Gata Guressi, spreading to almost every planet in the system and quickly building cities, trade routes, alliances, cultures, and languages.
