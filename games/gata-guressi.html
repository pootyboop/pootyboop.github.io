                Gata Guressi is a sci-fi RPG tech demo about the various planets and cultures of <a href="/projects/hierre.html">Hierre</a>, a fictional star system. You are Quuvol, a merchant who has travelled to trade port Kallay Tirridor on the planet of Voenn to sell your valuable shipment of a resource called ielsek.
            </p>
            <p>
                Quuvol is Guressi (native of the planet Guressen). Guressen's former government practised slavery, turning the rest of the system against Guressen and spreading the idea that all Guressi are slavers. Guressen's new leader Iusol has outlawed slavery, but the system is still skeptical of Guressi.
            </p>
            <p>
                Characters speak one or more of 10 languages which you must translate to sell ielsek. Languages aren't just random words - you can actually learn them and play without the translator if you wish.

            <p>
                This was a 3rd year university project developed in Unity. I aimed to develop a cohesive, immersive, optimized experience that simulated a slice of a larger sci-fi RPG. A few of the games inspirations include Prey's Talos I, Cyberpunk 2077's Heavy Hearts Club, Star Wars' Cantina, No Man's Sky spaceships, and rotation sushi restaurants.
            </p>
            <p>
                I wrote fictional languages and heavily built on the <a href="/projects/hierre.html">Hierre universe</a> for this project. Each planet/region has an icon, culture, aesthetic identity, and language which you can learn about by speaking to its inhabitants and inspecting cultural objects like banners, statues, etc.
            </p>
            <p>
                Each language has conventions and an auditory identity to build cohesion. Lunsca is nearly impossible for non-native speakers to understand. Sorpri uses long, flowery words and names instead of pronouns. Hiesca uses consistent prefixes, suffixes, and sounds to build its identity (e.g. the sound ‚Äúie‚Äù, two-syllable words, locations of importance ending with -enne, -erre, or -ette).
            </p>
            <p>
                If you're interested, you can find all up-to-date information about the system on the <a href="/projects/hierre.html">Hierre system</a> page, including info about languages, history, culture, and basically any other concrete detail about Hierre.
